        <h2 class="section-heading"><b>Go Makan Lah!</b> Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h6 class="section-heading mb-5">This Privacy Policy is effective as of <u>November 16th, 2018</u>.</h6>
        <hr /><br />
        <b>Go Makan Lah!</b> provides the Privacy Policy to inform users about policies and processes regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information (“personal information”) received from users via <a href="index.html">www.gomakan.sg</a>, other domains run by Go Makan Lah! or third party integrations (“Sites”).<br />

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">First things first</h5>
        Simply said, we do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties in any manner that could be harmful, dangerous or violating your privacy. We are here to provide you with the interaction platform and if we are making you uncomfortable about your privacy, it is a feedback we want to hear from you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:security@gomakan.sg?Subject=Security Matters" target="_top">security@gomakan.sg</a>.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Information we collect</h5>
        We collect and process information from you when you create an event, interact with an event or register on our Sites. You may be asked to enter details about you, but you always have an option to change your mind when you wish to anonymize yourself or even completely delete information about you from our service.<br /><br />

        <b>We collect information in the following ways:</b><br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Information you give us. For example, if you attend our tours, our services require you to sign up for a Go Makan Lah! account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name or email address. Or consider this, if you are simply enquiring or submitting a review for a friend - those are the moments when submitting your name is essential to provide you with required functionality, that’s why we ask for that.</li>

          <li>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you enter an event or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers. Go Makan Lah! may associate your device identifiers with your account.</li>
            <li>Log Information. When you use our services or view the content provided by Go Makan Lah!, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</li>
              <li>details about your connection, such as IP address, date, time, edge-location, ssl-protocol, ssl-cipher or time-taken to serve you requested site.</li>
              <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
              <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Go Makan Lah! account.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Location Information. When you use our website, we may collect and process information about your actual location. Currently, we only use IP address as the source information to approximately determine your current location.</li>
            <li>Unique Application Numbers. Certain tour requests may include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Go Makan Lah! when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.</li>
            <li>Local Storage. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</li>
            <li>Cookies and similar technologies. We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you use the Go Makan Lah! services, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services offered by our partners and third parties, such as advertising services or user behaviour analytics services. We may offer you services provided by our partners as a part of our Sites, in such case information about you is collected via a third party cookie.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        Information we obtain about you from our partners may be associated with your Go Makan Lah! account. When such information is associated with your Go Makan Lah! account, we treat it as personal information.
        <br />
        For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated with your Go Makan Lah! account, visit the “Transparency and choice” section of this Privacy Policy.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Why do we need your information and how we use it</h5>
        We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect our Sites and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like proper instructions how to get the most out of our services.<br />

        We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.<br />

        Go Makan Lah! processes personal information on servers of our infrastructure provider in Ireland and we use help of a few other specialized third party service providers as well. Therefore, we may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.<br />

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Transparency and choice</h5>
        People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>
          Wherever it is optional to collect additional information about you, we transparently inform you about what information we need, why we ask for it and we require your consent to process such information. When you change your mind, there is always a convenient way how to let us know.</li>
          <li>You can always set your own Cookie preferences and therefore decide whether you agree to be on our radar when it comes to ads or behaviour analytics or not.</li>
          <li>If you have a Go Makan Lah! account you can change information about you or completely permanently delete your account if you wish to be “forgotten”.</li>
          <li>If you don’t have a Go Makan Lah! account, but you were interacting with our website, you can anonymize your activity and wipeout any personal information related with such interaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Accessing and updating your personal information</h5>
        Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.<br />

        We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems - such information is completely removed according to our backup retention policy after 28 days.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h5>
        We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. If you feel like we’re falling short, please send us a complaint in writing <a href="contact.html">here</a> or via the email <a href="mailto:security@gomakan.sg?Subject=Security Matters" target="_top">security@gomakan.sg</a>. We value your feedback so we may contact you to ask for more information or to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.<br />

        In case you are curious how we have approached the EU General Data Protection Regulation, please see GDPR Commitment section of this page.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Changes</h5>
        Go Makan Lah! may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we will post any changes on this page. If you continue to use the services after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Minors</h5>
        Go Makan Lah! is committed to protecting the privacy of young children, and therefore does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information on the Sites or the service from persons under 16 years of age, except in compliance with children's online privacy protection law. Accordingly, children under the age of 16 may only use the service with the permission and supervision of their parents. Additionally, teachers and schools seeking to use the service in the classroom with children under 16 years of age are required to obtain express consent of such children's parents in compliance with the applicable law, prior to permitting such children to access or use the service.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Other privacy policies</h5>
        At our discretion, we may occasionally include or offer third party products or services on our Sites. As these have separate and independent privacy policies, we have no responsibility and liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. However, we do our best to protect the integrity of our Sites and welcome any feedback about these sites and services.

        <h5 class="section-heading mt-3 mb-1">Your consent</h5>
        By using our site, you consent to our Site Privacy Policy and the way how and for what purpose we process your personal information. Please contact us <a href="contact.html">here</a> or via the email <a href="mailto:security@gomakan.sg?Subject=Security Matters" target="_top">security@gomakan.sg</a> for any security matters.
