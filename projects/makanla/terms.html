        <hr /><br />
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE CUSTOMER TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a contract between you (the Customer) and us (Go Makan Lah!). It describes the services we will provide to you, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business relationship. It is a legal document so some of the language is necessarily “legalese”, but we have tried to make it as readable as possible. These terms are so important that we cannot provide our products and services to you unless you agree to them. By using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services, you are agreeing to these terms.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We periodically update these terms. You can find archived versions of the terms </span><a href="#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we know legal terms can sometimes be difficult to navigate, so we wanted to give you a roadmap of the Agreement:</span></p>

If the Consulting Services provided are not complete at the end of the Delivery Period due to our failure to make the necessary resources available to you or to perform our obligations, the Delivery Period will be extended to allow us to complete such Consulting Services.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might provide some or all elements of the Consulting Services through third party service providers. &nbsp;Consulting Services are non-cancellable and all fees for Consulting Services are non-refundable.</span></p>

There are different terms that apply depending on the subscription you purchase, and we cover those differences in this section. Unless otherwise agreed to in an Order, the following subscription types apply to the products specified:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1) Full-Service Subscriptions: Marketing Hub Enterprise, Marketing Hub Professional, and paid Add-Ons to our Full-Service Marketing Hub Products.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. <strong>Limits. </strong>The limits that apply to you will be specified in your Order Form, this Agreement or in our Product and Services Catalog, and for our Free Subscriptions, these limits may also be designated only from within the product itself. You must be 18 years of age (or 20 years of age, if you are subject to the laws of Japan) or older to use the Subscription Service.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our Full-Service Subscriptions, if we make modifications to the limits set forth in the Product and Services Catalog that would negatively impact you, these modifications will not apply to you until the start of your next renewal Subscription Term. On renewal, the current product usage limits in our Product and Services Catalog will apply to your subscription, unless you and we otherwise agree.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our Limited Service Subscriptions, we may change the limits that apply to you at any time in our sole discretion.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our Free Subscriptions, we may change the limits that apply to your use at any time in our sole discretion without notice to you, regardless of whether or not these are used in conjunction with other products or services for which you pay us a fee.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. <strong>Downgrades.</strong> For our Full-Service Subscriptions, you may not downgrade your subscription and in order to avoid additional charges, you should purchase the appropriate tier of Subscription Service for your anticipated needs. For our Limited Service Subscriptions, you may downgrade your subscription at the start of your next renewal Subscription Term, as specified in the ‘Fee Adjustments at Renewal’ section above.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. <strong>Modifications.</strong> We modify the Subscription Service from time to time, including by adding or deleting features and functions, in an effort to improve your experience.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For our Full-Service Subscriptions, we will not make changes to the Subscription Service that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our Limited Service Subscriptions and Free Subscriptions, we may make changes that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. <strong>Customer Support.&nbsp;</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you pay us a Subscription Fee for our Professional or Enterprise edition products, phone, email and in-app support is included at no additional cost.</span> Phone support for these Subscriptions is available from 8pm Sunday to 8pm Friday EST (Eastern Standard Time), with reduced hours during holidays in Singapore, Ireland, and the US. We accept email and in-app &nbsp;support questions 24 Hours per Day x 7 Days per Week. Email and in-app questions can be submitted through the help widget in the lower right hand corner of your account or by following the link at http://help.gomakan.sg. Email and in-app responses are provided during phone support hours only. We attempt to respond to email and in-app support questions within one business day; in practice, our responses are generally even faster. We do not promise or guarantee any specific response time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>We may limit or deny your access to support if we determine, in our reasonable discretion, that you are acting, or have acted, in a way that results or has resulted in misuse of support or abuse of Go Makan Lah! representatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues resulting from your use of API's or your modifications to code in the Subscription Service may be outside the scope of support. We will only provide support for integrations which are listed in-app as being supported by Go Makan Lah!</span></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not pay a Subscription Fee, support is available to you through the Go Makan Lah! Community available at: </span><a href="#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community.gomakan.sg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. <strong>Notice of Non-Renewal.</strong> Your subscription will automatically renew according to the ‘Term and Renewal’ section above.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless otherwise specified in your Order, to prevent renewal of a Full-Service Subscription, you or we must give written notice of non-renewal and this written notice must be received no less than ten (10) days in advance of the end of the Subscription Term.&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent continuation of the Subscription Term of a Free Subscription, you or we may close your account.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. <strong>Retrieval of Customer Data.</strong> &nbsp;For our Full-Service Subscriptions, as long as you have paid all fees owed to us, if you make a written request within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of your subscription, we will provide you with temporary access to the Subscription Service to retrieve, or we will provide you with copies of, all Customer Data then in our possession or control. If we provide you with temporary access to the account, we may charge a re-activation fee. We may withhold access to Customer Data until you pay any fees owed to us. Thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of your Subscription, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide you the Customer Data and may, unless legally prohibited, delete all Customer Data in our systems or otherwise in our control.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For our Limited Service and Free Subscriptions, we will not provide you with any access to Customer Data after termination or expiration of your subscription.</span></p>
